                      Hello, this is Josef, an aspired front_end computer
                      programmer as well as a graphic designer focused on UI and
                      UX. I taught myself photography, image
                      manipulation/editing, filming and now front-end UI/UX and
                      MERN fullStack(including javascript, Node.js, React.js).
                      Although my background is in mechanical engineering, Iâ€™ve
                      been passionate about designing and creating beautiful and
                      functional websites and pages for a long time. To work and
                      excel in this field is my dream. I'm looking for an
                      internship in the design field from filmmaker, graphic
                      designer to frontend UI/UX or junior web dev. Do not
                      hesitate to contact me if you think I am a designer
                      material. Thanks so much.
